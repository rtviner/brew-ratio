Pour until the total weight of water is reached or until water hits the No. 4 on the chamber., Stir the slurry. Place the plunger on the brew chamber and pull up slightly to create a pressure seal., At 1:15, remove the pressure seal and stir the slurry. Put the plunger back on and gently press down with steady pressure, stop as soon as you hear a hissing sound."
